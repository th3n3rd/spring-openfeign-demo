# Spring OpenFeign Demo

This repository hosts the code for a simple demo of [Spring Cloud OpenFeign](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-openfeign/docs/current/reference/html/).

The current codebase reflect the following demonstrations through iteration:

* Simple integration of a RESTful service via `OpenFeign` declarative client
* Testing declarative clients using `Consumer Driven Contract Testing` via [Pact](https://docs.pact.io/implementation_guides/jvm/readme)
* Support for payload conversion for complex types
* Support for load balancing via [Spring Cloud Loadbalancer](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-commons/docs/current/reference/html/#spring-cloud-loadbalancer)
* Support for kubernetes load balancing via [Spring Cloud Kubernetes](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-kubernetes/docs/current/reference/html/)
